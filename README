# AI Counsel: Pro Se Litigant Legal Assistant (Blueprint Project)

## What is This?

A privacy-first, offline, open-source legal assistant for people representing themselves in court (pro se litigants), starting with Texas cases.

## How to Use

Right now, this repo holds the basic “building blocks” of the app — each file is a module (like a Lego piece).  
Future steps: connect the modules, add features, and make it user-friendly!

## How to Help

- Review the code blocks.
- Suggest improvements.
- Help connect the modules.
- Ask questions or open issues.

## Vision

Empower regular people to build, manage, and understand their own legal cases with AI-powered tools — all while keeping their data private and secure.
